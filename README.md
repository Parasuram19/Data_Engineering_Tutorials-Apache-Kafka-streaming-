# Apache Kafka Streaming Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of tutorials and examples demonstrating various aspects of Apache Kafka and stream processing.  It's designed to help you learn how to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications using Kafka.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers a range of Kafka topics, including (but not limited to):

* **Basic Kafka Concepts:**  Explanation of fundamental concepts like topics, partitions, brokers, producers, and consumers.
* **Producer Examples:** Demonstrations of how to produce messages to Kafka topics using different programming languages (e.g., Java, Python).  Includes examples of synchronous and asynchronous message sending.
* **Consumer Examples:**  Illustrates how to consume messages from Kafka topics, including consumer groups, offsets management, and different consumption strategies.
* **Kafka Streams:**  Examples showcasing the Kafka Streams library for building stream processing applications. This might include transformations, aggregations, joins, and windowing.
* **Kafka Connect:**  Examples of using Kafka Connect to integrate Kafka with other systems, such as databases, message queues, or cloud platforms.  This could cover both source and sink connectors.
* **Schema Registry:** Demonstrations of how to use a schema registry (like Confluent Schema Registry) to manage and evolve schemas for your Kafka messages.  This ensures data consistency and compatibility.
* **Real-world Use Cases:**  Potential examples of how Kafka can be used in real-world scenarios, like clickstream processing, log aggregation, or real-time analytics.
* **Deployment and Configuration:**  Guidance on setting up and configuring a Kafka cluster, including best practices for production environments.

## Getting Started

To get started with these tutorials, you'll need to have the following prerequisites installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):**  A compatible JDK (e.g., Java 8 or later) is required for running Java-based examples.
* **Apache Kafka:** Download and install Apache Kafka from the official website.
* **ZooKeeper:** Kafka relies on ZooKeeper for coordination and configuration management.  Install and run ZooKeeper before starting Kafka.
* **Programming Languages:**  Install the necessary programming languages and libraries for the examples you want to explore (e.g., Python, Java, etc.).
* **Build Tools:**  If the projects use build tools like Maven or Gradle, make sure you have them installed.
